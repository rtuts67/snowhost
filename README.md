# snowhost
New Project Summer 2017 (Solo)

Idea: To help allow skiers/snowboarders to register as a host for other skiers at ski resort destinations and rent them as a guide.

MVP: Create a single page web-app that a person can register their information into a small local database on my computer, and that their information will be displayed on
a "Select A Ski Host" page.

Stretch: get a list of ski resorts from a 3rd party api and render it on become a ski host.

Future: Will turn this potentially into a business idea with full functionality (like airbnb) except for ski hosts. 401 project idea?

User stories:

As a user I would like the ability to register as a Ski Host
As a user I would like to be able to see a list of registered ski hosts with their email and the ski resort they can give me a tour.

Page Scaffolding:

Home page: Will have a small description of the purpose of the website, and a section for site visitor to register as a ski host

When information is submitted, It will go to a small data base on my comp for using postgres and sequel for the ski host registered user information

Select A Ski Host Page will render the list of ski hosts registered in the database

Contact Us will have basic email information
